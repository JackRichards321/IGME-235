# IGME-235

My name is Jack Richards. Well, Jack is actually my middle name, but I have gone by it my whole life. My first name is Stephen, just like my dad's. I am a second year New Media Interactive Development student at Rochester Institute of Technology, and I play for the club ultimate frisbee team there.
